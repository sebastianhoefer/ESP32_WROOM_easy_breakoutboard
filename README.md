# ESP32_WROOM_easy_breakoutboard
ESP32 WROOM/ breadboard prototyping/Eagle

This is an easy-to-use ESP32 WROOM breakout board with built-in voltage regulator
and two switches for the reset and boot modes. It works well for getting started with
the ESP32 system. Feel free to optimize the board with a 3.3V UART bridge.

Have a lot of fun!
